# planetary_close_approaches
Calculates the local maximums of planetary distances over a period of (Earth) years.

Builds on the SkyField package to calculate (local) distance extremes. Defaults to an observer on Earth 
and calculates for Mars and the Sun.  This was created to rank close approaches of Mars to help answer the question: 
"When [was Mars last|will Mars be] closer?" during an upcoming close approach.

Note: the JPL DE421 ephemeris file will be downloaded to assist in the calculations and requires 17MB of disk space.  
It includes all planets in the solar system plus Earth's moon (Moon), Pluto and the Earth-Moon Barycenter.
